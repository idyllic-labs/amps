# {question}

Consider this question from three different perspectives.

<Structured name="perspectives">
  <Field name="items" type="list">
    <Field name="role" type="text" description="A specific expert role (e.g. economist, ethicist, engineer)" />
    <Field name="angle" type="text" description="What aspect they would focus on" />
  </Field>
</Structured>

<Loop name="viewpoints" over={perspectives.items}>

## Perspective: {item.role}

You are a {item.role}. Answer the question "{question}" focusing on {item.angle}. Be specific and opinionated.

<Generation name="response" />

</Loop>

# Synthesis

You've now heard from {perspectives.items.length} experts:

{viewpoints.map(v => `- **${v.item.role}**: ${v.response.slice(0, 100)}...`).join("\n")}

Synthesize these perspectives into a balanced conclusion. Where do they agree? Where do they conflict? What's the most important takeaway?
